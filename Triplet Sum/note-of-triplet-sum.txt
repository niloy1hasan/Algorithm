--------- triplet sum or three sum ---------

this is not any special type algorithm, this is a type of problem,
that need to solve through two pointers or hashmap

problem description:
give an array and a target value,
need to find target value by sum of three different indexed values

example:

given, array = -1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 11
and target = 6

so, can get 6 => [1, 2, 3] and [-1, 1, 6]
