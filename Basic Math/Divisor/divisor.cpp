    Divisors are numbers that divide another number exactly, with nothing left over.
    Example: 16
    The number 16 can be divided exactly by:
    1, 2, 4, 8, 16

    These divisors come in pairs:
    1 and 16
    2 and 8
    4 and 4
    8 and 2
    16 and 1

    After reaching the square root of the number (which is 4 for 16),
    the divisors start repeating in reverse order.

    So, when finding all divisors of a number,
    only need to check from 1 up to the square root of that number.
    For each number that divides it evenly,
    can also find its pair (target number รท that number).
